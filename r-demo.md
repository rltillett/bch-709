# Introduction to R via a wild demo

We're finally ready to begin learning how to use the R statistical programming language and the Rstudio program to analyze data and generate plots. We'll be integrating material from [Hadley's R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz), as well as other helpful lessons borrowed from others (modified to my spec) and that I'll make specifically for our class. There's a lot to learn, such as:

* What is this R language?
* Is it anything like bash programming? (not really)
* Is it weird (often)
* What is Rstudio? Why is Rstudio?
* Ok, what do we mean by data analysis and "Data Science" in R?

## (Hadley's) Data science analysis in R

R is a popular, free, open language for taking data and computing statistics on it. And for making great-looking plots of it. The stats can be descriptive (distributions of values, for example) and they can be modeling and test-based (Is gene A over-expressed in Treatment vs. Control?). In the welcome page to Hadley's R for Data Science, he tells us that

>>This book will teach you how to do data science with R: You’ll learn how to get your data into R, get it into the most useful structure, transform it, visualise it and model it. In this book, you will find a practicum of skills for data science. Just as a chemist learns how to clean test tubes and stock a lab, you’ll learn how to clean data and draw plots—and many other things besides. These are the skills that allow data science to happen, and here you will find the best practices for doing each of these things with R. You’ll learn how to use the grammar of graphics, literate programming, and reproducible research to save time. You’ll also learn how to manage cognitive resources to facilitate discoveries when wrangling, visualising, and exploring data.

Let's read on the next section directly from the website version of the book for a bit more orientation[https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html):

I think I agree with Hadley, that while it might make logical sense to teach you step by step how to process data in R (and we will), the early tasks involved are unfamiliar, dry, complicated, not exciting nor stimulating, and lend themselves to questions of **_Why are we doing this thing right now? Why are we even here!?_**

Let's answer that with a [pretty intense demo from youtube. I may have to slow his speed down to 75%, because Greg Martin is good at this stuff, and he's very fast: ](https://youtu.be/ANMuuq502rE)
